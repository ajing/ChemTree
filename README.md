#ChemTree

ChemTree is a new way to understand the chemical complexity within the molecule library. The framework of ChemTree is highly modularized to incorporate different molecular characterization (like fingerprint or molecular properties) and similarity functions.

The purpose for ChemTree is 1). the overall view about structure similarity in the molecule library; 2). to understand the relation between molecule structure and other properties by mapping of colors or brush selection of molecules; 3). to understand whether your fingerprint or similarity function well suited for your question (by TreeViz/Transition/index.html).

ChemTree contains two part: clusterViz and TreeViz. clusterViz is for building the tree from a molecule library and prepare input file for TreeViz. TreeViz is for interactive visualization of the tree.

More detailed explanations for each function and file can be found in the folder clusterViz and TreeViz.
