#ChemTreeMap

ChemTreeMap is an interactive, bioinformatics tool designed to explore chemical space and mine the relationships between chemical structure, molecular properties, and biological activity. ChemTreeMap synergistically combines extended connectivity fingerprints and a neighbor-joining algorithm to produce a hierarchical tree with branch lengths proportional to molecular similarity. Compound properties are shown by leaf color, size, and outline to yield a user-defined visualization of the tree. Two representative analyses are included to demonstrate ChemTreeMap's capabilities and utility: assessing dataset overlap and mining structure-activity relationships (SAR).
