Introduction
============

ChemTreeMap is a novel program for visualization of
biochemical similarity in molecular datasets. It allows for users
to interactively explore the chemical space covered by a set of small
molecules. It is written by `Jing Lu`_, a PhD
student under the supervision of Dr. `Heather Carlson`_.

Software
--------

Briefly, the data processing is done using :doc:`Python <backend>` for calculations of similarity,
and :doc:`JavaScript<frontend>` for visualization:

The workflow is shown in the following Fig. 1.1.

   The workflow for ChemTreeMap

There is a `demo`_ (http://ajing.github.io/ChemTreeMap/index.html#example) of the interactive frontend for some example datasets hosted on GitHub.
