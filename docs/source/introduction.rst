Introduction
============

ChemTreeMap is a novel visualization technique for exploring
biochemical similarity in molecular datasets interactively. This is the documentation
for an interactive implementation, written by `Jing Lu`_, a PhD
student under the supervision of Dr. `Heather Carlson`_.

Software
--------

Briefly, the data processing is done on :doc:`Python backend <backend>`,
and the visualization is processed by the :doc:`JavaScript frontend <frontend>`:

There is a `demo`_ of the interactive frontend for some example datasets hosted on GitHub.

Paper
-----

The paper has been submitted to `Bioinformatics`_.
